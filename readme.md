## LoggersBro - The bot that is useful, yet nobody needs

This bot is a simple example on how to use the [topggwebhooks4j library](https://github.com/Hopefuls/topggwebhooks4j). 

It uses the library [Javacord](https://github.com/Javacord/Javacord). You can modify however you like to, you can use it in your own bot etc. 

**It is pretty much just a demonstration bot in a nutshell.**
